            <p>My interests include construction technology suited to create large infrastructure applications. I studied full stack development in Le Wagon London and hold a Bachelor's of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of Central Florida. Currently creating projects via react.js and Ruby on Rails as well as learning Java and Python. In my free time, I am a voracious reader and an aspiring explorer of NYC museums.</p>
