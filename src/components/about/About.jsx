            <p>Iâ€™m a Software Engineer based in Brooklyn, New York City. My background in full stack development started at Le Wagon in London, United Kingdom where I was introduced to full stack development. Currently learning react.js and node.js as well as Python. I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of Central Florida and intend to pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from a top university in the upcoming year. In my free time, I am an avid reader of nonfiction, aspiring decent guitart player and an explorer of NYC museums.</p>
